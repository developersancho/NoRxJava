Thinking like a Rxjava library creator,Why we need use RxJava...I will tell you everything about Rxjava:RxJava Study Resources、Rxjava Usage and Interpretation of Rxjava source code...


## Part1 RxJava Study Resources:

[https://github.com/esoxjem/MovieGuide](https://github.com/esoxjem/MovieGuide):An Android app that showcases the MVP pattern and RxJava.

[给 Android 开发者的 RxJava 详解](http://gank.io/post/560e15be2dca930e00da1083):Introduce Rxjava To Chinese Android developer.

[RxAndroid And Kotlin (Part 1)](https://medium.com/@ahmedrizwan/rxandroid-and-kotlin-part-1-f0382dc26ed8):I started with RxAndroid about a week ago. At first, I didn’t really get it… I mean, I grasped the concept but I didn’t understand where I should be using it. But then after going through a few examples and a few really good articles (links at the end)… I just got it! 

[REPLACE ASYNCTASK AND ASYNCTASKLOADER WITH RX.OBSERVABLE – RXJAVA ANDROID PATTERNS](http://blog.stablekernel.com/replace-asynctask-asynctaskloader-rx-observable-rxjava-android-patterns/):I'd like to explore some patterns that have emerged as I've worked on various projects that rely on RxJava as the primary backbone of the architecture.There are plenty of “Getting Started” type posts talking about RxJava, some of which are in the context of Android. But at this point, I imagine there are people out there who like what they hear so far but aren't really sure how or why to to use it when solving concrete problems in their Android projects.(Chinese translation:[用RxJava.Observable取代AsyncTask和AsyncTaskLoader-RxJava Android模版](http://blog.csdn.net/zhaokaiqiang1992/article/details/44751003))

[When the Avengers meet Dagger2, RxJava and Retrofit in a clean way](http://saulmm.github.io/when-Thor-and-Hulk-meet-dagger2-rxjava-1/):Recently, a lot articles, frameworks, and talks at the android community, are appearing talking about testing and software architecture, as said in the last Droidcon Spain, we are focusing on how to do robust applications instead on how to develop specific features. That denotes that the Android framework and the current Android commnunity is reaching some level of maturity.(Chinese translation:[当复仇者联盟遇上Dragger2、RxJava和Retrofit的巧妙结合](http://www.devtf.cn/?p=565))

[ Don't break the chain: use RxJava's compose() operator](http://blog.danlew.net/2015/03/02/dont-break-the-chain/):What if you have a set of operators that you want to reuse for multiple streams? For example, I frequently use subscribeOn() and observeOn() because I want to process data in a worker thread then subscribe to it on the main thread. It'd be great if I could apply this logic to all my streams in a consistent, reusable manner.(Chinese translation:[避免打断链式结构：使用.compose( )操作符](http://www.jianshu.com/p/e9e03194199e))
