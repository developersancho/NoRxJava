[RxAndroid And Kotlin (Part 1)](https://medium.com/@ahmedrizwan/rxandroid-and-kotlin-part-1-f0382dc26ed8):I started with RxAndroid about a week ago. At first, I didn’t really get it… I mean, I grasped the concept but I didn’t understand where I should be using it. But then after going through a few examples and a few really good articles (links at the end)… I just got it! 

[REPLACE ASYNCTASK AND ASYNCTASKLOADER WITH RX.OBSERVABLE – RXJAVA ANDROID PATTERNS](http://blog.stablekernel.com/replace-asynctask-asynctaskloader-rx-observable-rxjava-android-patterns/):I'd like to explore some patterns that have emerged as I've worked on various projects that rely on RxJava as the primary backbone of the architecture.There are plenty of “Getting Started” type posts talking about RxJava, some of which are in the context of Android. But at this point, I imagine there are people out there who like what they hear so far but aren't really sure how or why to to use it when solving concrete problems in their Android projects.(中译[用RxJava.Observable取代AsyncTask和AsyncTaskLoader-RxJava Android模版](http://blog.csdn.net/zhaokaiqiang1992/article/details/44751003))
