# NoRxJava
Thinking like a rxjava library creator,Why we need use RxJava...


## Every Resource about Rxjava:

[https://github.com/esoxjem/MovieGuide](https://github.com/esoxjem/MovieGuide):An Android app that showcases the MVP pattern and RxJava.

[给 Android 开发者的 RxJava 详解](http://gank.io/post/560e15be2dca930e00da1083):Introduce Rxjava To Chinese Android developer.

[<<RxAndroid And Kotlin (Part 1)>>](https://medium.com/@ahmedrizwan/rxandroid-and-kotlin-part-1-f0382dc26ed8):I started with RxAndroid about a week ago. At first, I didn’t really get it… I mean, I grasped the concept but I didn’t understand where I should be using it. But then after going through a few examples and a few really good articles (links at the end)… I just got it!
